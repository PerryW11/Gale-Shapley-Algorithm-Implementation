# Gale-Shapley-Implementation

 As part of my Design and Analysis of Algorithms course, I am required to make the Gale Shapley algorithm from scratch.
 
 
 In this process, I have decided to use C++. 

 Second parameter when running program is the amount of pairs you'd like to make (dynamically generates and randomizes list of people and preferences).
 
 ./gs 1000
 
^^^ (1000 pairs will be made out of 1000 men and 1000 women)
 
 Thanks for checking it out!
